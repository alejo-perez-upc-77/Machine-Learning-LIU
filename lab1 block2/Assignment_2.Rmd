# Assignment2

Your task is to implement the EM algorithm for mixtures of multivariate Bernoulli distributions. Please use the R template below to solve the assignment. Then, use your implementation to show what happens when your mixture model has too few and too many components, i.e. set K=2,3,4 and compare results. Please provide a short explanation as well.

First, it will be necessary to define our function of density of probability corresponding to the Bernoulli distribution. Let $D$ be the dimensions of our vectors of observations $x_n$ and $\mu_k$. 
$$Bernoulli(x_i,\mu_k)=\prod_{i=1}^{D}\mu_{ki}^{x_{i}}(1-\mu_{ki})^{1-x_{i}} $$

As for our matrix $z_{nk}$, its components will be defined as follows, with their values $n$ comprised from 1 to N observations for $X$ and its values k from 1 to K, being K the number of mixture components $\pi_k$. This will be the matrix of fractional component assignments.

$$z_{nk} = \frac{\pi_k * Bernoulli (x_n,\mu_k)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k*Bernoulli(x_n , \mu_k)}$$
Now, the log-likelihood function will be defined in this way:

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{K} p(z_{n}|x_n,\mu,\pi)*[ln(\pi_k) +\sum_{i=1}^{D}[x_{ni}*ln(\mu_{ki})+(1-x_{ni})*ln(1-\mu_{ki})]]$$
After Applying MLE over each mixture components and weights, we obtain:
$$ \hat{n_k}^{MLE} = \sum_{n=1}^N z_{nk} $$
$$ \pi^{MLE}_k = \frac{\hat{n_k}}{N} $$
$$ \mu_{ki}^{MLE} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N z_{nk}x_{ni}}{\hat{n}} $$
After this statement, executions of our implementation will be shown for K=2,3,4.

Once the experiments have been performed, let this table summarize results.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
table_mat <- cbind(c(2,3,4),c(16,62,66),c(-6496.662,-6743.326, -6874.497))
colnames(table_mat) <- c("K", "number of Iterations", "Log-Likelihood Value")
knitr::kable((table_mat))
```

As we can see, creating 2 different clusters ($k=2$), results in a faster convergence, needing just 16 iterations. As K increases, the log-likelihood decreases. This could be explained from an overfitting-based approach, leading us to think that too many components could result in worse performance.
